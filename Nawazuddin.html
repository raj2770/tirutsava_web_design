    <strong>
      Early Life
    </strong>
    Siddiqui was born on 19 May 1974 in Budhana, a small town in Muzaffarnagar district, Uttar Pradesh, India,
     into a zamindari Muslim family of Lambardars. He is the eldest of eight siblings. He spent most of his youth in Uttarakhand.

He graduated with a Bachelor of Science in chemistry from Gurukul Kangri Vishwavidyalaya, Haridwar. Following this, he worked as a
 chemist in Vadodara for a year, before leaving for Delhi in search of a new job. Once in Delhi, he was instantly drawn to acting
  after watching a play. In pursuit of securing admission to the National School of Drama (NSD) in New Delhi, he acted in over ten 
  plays with a group of friends, including one in Dehradun, to fulfil one of the criteria for admission.

    <strong>
      Career 
    </strong>

    Siddiqui went to the National School of Drama in New Delhi. After graduating in 1999, he moved to Mumbai.

He made his Bollywood debut in the year 1999 with a small role in the Aamir Khan starrer Sarfarosh. He then appeared in Ram 
Gopal Varma's Shool (1999) and Jungle (2000), and Rajkumar Hirani's Munnabhai MBBS (2003). After moving to Mumbai, he tried to get
 work in television serials, but did not achieve much success. He did a short film, The Bypass, in 2003, where he appeared with
  Irrfan Khan. Beyond that, between 2002 and 2005, he was largely out of work and lived in a flat that he shared with four other 
  people, surviving by conducting occasional acting workshops. In 2004, which was one of the worst years of his struggle, Siddiqui 
  couldn't pay rent. He asked an NSD senior if he could stay with him. The senior allowed him to share his apartment in Goregaon 
  suburb if he was willing to cook meals for him.

Between 2004 and 2007, Siddiqui had a few minor roles, including in the film Black Friday, which came out in 2007 and was a nominee
 for the Golden Leopard. In 2009, he appeared in a cameo role in the song "Emotional Atyachar" in the movie Dev D, playing the role
  of Rangila. He performed a duet with Rasila (known together as Patna ke Presley). In the same year, he appeared in New York.
   However, it was his role of a journalist in Anusha Rizvi's Peepli Live (2010), that first got him wide recognition as an actor.
    In 2012, he appeared in Prashant Bhargava's Patang: The Kite, which premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival and the
     Tribeca Film Festival. Siddiqui's performance was praised by film critic Roger Ebert, who stated that the role "transformed 
     his acting style" and he awarded the actor the 'Thumbsup Trophy'. The film was subsequently released in the U.S. and Canada,
      and garnered much attention with rave reviews from The New York Times.

Siddiqui then appeared in Kahaani (2012), in which he played the archetypal short-tempered intelligence officer Khan. Anurag Kashyap's
 gangster epic Gangs of Wasseypur followed, which furthered the actor's fame. He played his first primary role as Sonu Duggal in 
 Ashim Ahluwalia's Miss Lovely, which premiered at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival, a role Siddiqui describes as his "most real 
 performance so far". Siddiqui then followed this with the sequel to Gangs of Wasseypur. In 2013, he played the lead role in the 
 horror flick Aatma. The Lunchbox (2013) premiered as part of the International Critics' Week at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival and
  won him multiple awards. He appeared in Aamir Khan's 2012 release Talash. In 2014, he played the lead antagonist Shiv Gajra in the
   blockbuster Kick.

In 2015, Siddiqui's films Bajrangi Bhaijaan and Manjhi - The Mountain Man were released, and he was praised for his roles.
 He received the Special Jury Award at the 2012 National Film Awards and the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor in 2013. 
 His work in Raman Raghav 2.0 in 2016 won him the Fancine Malaga Award in Spain and in the Asia Pacific Screen Awards, both in
  the category of Best Actor. Manto (2018) was a groundbreaking performance that won him Best Actor at the 2018 Asia Pacific Screen
   Awards.
